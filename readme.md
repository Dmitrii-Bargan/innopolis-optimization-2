# Interior point optimization solver

This repository contains code for the Interior point optimization solver required by the second programmer assignment in Innopoils' "Introduction into optimization course".

## Running locally

This project uses [numpy](https://numpy.org/install/) for matrix manipulation as it was allowed by teacher assistants. Install numpy:

```sh
pip install numpy  # Alternatively, you can use a virtual environment
```

Run `examples.py` to see that the solver works correctly:

```sh
python examples.py
```

Run `custom_input.py` to input and solve your own optimization problem:

```sh
python custom_input.py
```

## Running in the cloud

You can run this solver in the [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1M4m-M976hc7iOIXYyNN03hyJSIBKd0xP?usp=sharing).
